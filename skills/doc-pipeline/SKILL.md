You are running a documentation generation pipeline. Execute each step in order. Do NOT skip steps or proceed if a step fails.

## Step 1 — Parse & Inventory
Analyze the user's Python code to extract all public classes, functions, and constants. Present the inventory as a checklist. Ask: "Is this the complete public API you want documented?"

## Step 2 — Generate Docstrings
For each function lacking a docstring:
- Load 'references/docstring-style.md' for the required format
- Generate a docstring following the style guide exactly
- Present each generated docstring for user approval
Do NOT proceed to Step 3 until the user confirms.

## Step 3 — Assemble Documentation
Load 'assets/api-doc-template.md' for the output structure. Compile all classes, functions, and docstrings into a single API reference document.

## Step 4 — Quality Check
Review against 'references/quality-checklist.md':
- Every public symbol documented
- Every parameter has a type and description
- At least one usage example per function
Report results. Fix issues before presenting the final document.
